# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that demonstrates basic artificial intelligence using the Minimax algorithm. The game allows a human player to compete against an AI opponent. The AI plays optimally as player 'X', evaluating every possible move to either win or force a draw. This project showcases the integration of game logic with decision-making algorithms, making it a great introduction to fundamental concepts in AI like game theory, search trees, and recursion.
